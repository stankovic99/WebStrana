              <p class="blogtekst">Grand Prix motorcycle racing is the premier class of motorcycle road racing events held on road 
                  circuits sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM). 
                  Independent motorcycle racing events have been held since the start of the twentieth century 
                  and large national events were often given the title Grand Prix.
                   The foundation of the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme as the international 
                  governing body for motorcycle sport in 1949 provided 
                  the opportunity to coordinate rules and regulations in order that selected events could 
                  count towards official World Championships.
                   It is the oldest established motorsport world championship.
                Grand Prix motorcycles are purpose-built racing machines that are unavailable for purchase by the general public and 
                unable to be ridden legally on public roads. This contrasts with the various production-based categories of racing, 
                such as the Superbike World Championship and the Isle of Man TT Races that feature modified versions of road-going 
                motorcycles available to the public. The current top division is known as MotoGP since 2002 when the four-stroke era 
                began. Prior to that, the largest class was 500cc, both of which form a historical continuum as the official 
                World Championship, although all classes have official status.
                The championship is currently divided into four classes: the eponymous MotoGP, Moto2, Moto3 and MotoE. 
                The first three classes use four-stroke engines, while the MotoE class (new in 2019) uses electric motorcycles. 
                The 2019 MotoGP season comprises 19 Grands Prix, with 12 held in Europe, three in Asia, two in the Americas, 
                and one each in Australia and the Middle East.
                The most successful rider in Grand Prix history is Giacomo Agostini with 15 titles and 122 race wins. 
                In the top-flight series, Agostini holds the title record with eight, followed by active riders Valentino Rossi 
                with seven and Marc Márquez with six. As of 2019, Rossi holds the record for most top-flight race wins with 89.
