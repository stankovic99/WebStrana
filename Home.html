                        Hi! My name is Stefan Stankovic, a student at FEIT, direction Computer Technologies and Engineering, 
                        3rd grade. I'm 21 years old and I'm very interested in computer science. Programming has become interesting to 
                        me since I started college. I also have many other areas of interest such as interior
                        design and any kind of woodwork. I have worked as a carpenter for 4 summers.
